GSAP Animation",Super Bowl promotion for the most bacon-ified burger to ever exist,"Our team at Struck was tasked with designing and building a full digital promotion experience to showcase the new Bacon Insider Burger; a burger, with bacon INSIDE the patty ðŸ¤¯. We shipped an awesome landing page, from GSAP scroll-based animations of curly fry trees to a custom asteroids game I built where you fly a bork and shoot bacon at floating burgers. This is peak on-brand Jack in the Box and was a blast to build!","Watch the commercial | https://www.ispot.tv/ad/7TF_/jack-in-the-box-bacon-insider-super-bowl-2014-moink

GSAP Animation",Recruiting and marketing site for Nickelodeon's Animation Studio,"While I had a more limited development role on this project, I built a couple really cool features including the global navigation as well as a custom abstracted character carousel. The carousel was a challenge to build, but proved to be a fun and effective way to communicate the breadth of NAS characters over the years. Thankfully, it still lives on the site today even after a couple re-designs.",,,,,,

The experience featured a custom sound board where the user could create their own beats, visualize their creation, and enter to win prizes. We far exceeded client expectations and help bring a big jump in user interaction not seen for previos promotions. Go ahead, [make a beat](http://work.union.agency/beats-by-union/)",,,,,,

I was given an amazing opportunity to design the inaugural Pac-12 Football Championship logo, which won a public competetion and was emblazoned all over Autzen Stadium where I sat watching my Oregon Ducks win that first ever championship game; the first of many. I continued my freelance work for the Pac-12 designing logos and finished with the updated Football Championship logo that you see today. ",,,,,,
